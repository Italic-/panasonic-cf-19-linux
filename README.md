# Panasonic Toughbook CF-19

For Linux on Panasonic Toughbook CF-19, improve the following functionality:
- Touch screen calibration and long-press - right-click functionality
- Tablet button driver (on-screen keyboard, enter, screen-rotation, lock buttons)
- Screen rotation script, which rotates touch-screen also with the desktop
- On-screen keyboard toggle script (for _xvkbd_)

For usage instruction, see README in `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/src/panasonic-hbtn`.

Tested and working on a Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 Mk3.
